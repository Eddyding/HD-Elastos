==================
In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet or natural satellite, 
which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle. 
The crusts of Earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies have 
been generated largely by igneous processes, and these crusts are richer in incompatible 
elements than their respective mantles.
